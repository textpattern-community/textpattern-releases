== Language Files ==

All language strings used by the Textpattern CMS are stored in the database
(as of 1.0RC4 and later). You can change your language by selecting from
the installed languages in "admin -> preferences". To install additional
languages, go to "admin -> preferences -> Install Language". The
preferred and default method of installation is to query a remote server
(at textpattern.com) to ensure that you always get the most recent
set of languages in their most recent state.

In case your computer is not connected to the internet, the fallback method
is to install from the files that are in the /textpattern/lang directory.
Please be aware that these files may be outdated and newer language strings
may be missing.

If you are interested in translating Textpattern into your own language, we
would like to hear from you on our forums at http://forum.textpattern.com/.
