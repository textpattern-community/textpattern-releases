== Installation ==

* Extract the files to your site (in the web root, or choose a
  subdirectory). The top-level index.php should reside in this
  directory, as should the /textpattern/ and the /rpc/ directory.
* Create or establish the existence of a working MySQL database,
  load /textpattern/setup/ (or /subpath/textpattern/setup/) in a
  browser, and follow the directions.

== Upgrading ==

* Log out of the admin-side.
* Verify the existence of a working database and file backup.
* Replace the three files in your main installation directory
  (index.php, css.php and .htaccess), everything in your /rpc/ directory
  and everything in your /textpattern/ directory (except config.php)
  with the corresponding files in this distribution. css.php and /rpc/
  might not yet exist in your current site.
* When you login to the admin-side, the relevant upgrade script is
  run automatically. Please take a look into diagnostics to find out
  whether there are any errors and whether the correct version number
  is displayed.
  NOTE: Upgrades from versions below 4.2.0 will present this warning
  upon your very first login to the admin-side:
    Warning: Unknown column 'user_name' in 'where clause' select name,
    val from txp_prefs where prefs_id=1 AND user_name='' in
    /path/to/your/site/textpattern/lib/txplib_db.php on line xx
  This is expected behaviour for the very first login after an upgrade.
  Every further move in the admin side will not throw an error message.
* Verify all preference settings.

== Getting Started ==

* FAQ is available at http://textpattern.com/faq/
* In-depth documentation and a comprehensive tag index is available in the
  Textpattern documentation at http://textpattern.net/
* You can get support and information via:
   Forum:    http://forum.textpattern.com/
   Twitter:  http://textpattern.com/@textpattern
   Google+:  http://textpattern.com/+
   Facebook: http://textpattern.com/facebook
* If you are running an Apache web server, rename the @.htaccess-dist@ file
  in the "/files" directory to ".htaccess" to prohibit direct URL access to
  your files. Thus the only route to these files becomes through
  "/file_download". We recommend you consider employing this feature or
  that you move your "/files" directory out of a web-accessible location.
  Once moved, you can tell Textpattern of your new directory location from
  the Advanced Preferences.
* There are additional resources for the default front-side theme, such as
  Sass preprocessor files and extra feature modules, available at:
    http://textpattern.com/default-theme/tree/master/

== IMPORTANT ==

* Check back regularly at http://textpattern.com to see if updates are
  available. Updates are as painless as possible, and often fix important bugs
  or security-related issues.
