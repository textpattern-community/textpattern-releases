== Language Files ==

All language strings used by Textpattern CMS are stored in the database.
You can change your site language and/or user interface language
independently by selecting from the installed languages in the
Admin -> Languages administration panel. You may also install additional
languages from there.

All language strings are installed from files in the /textpattern/lang
directory. If you wish to update any language to use the latest strings:

1. Visit https://textpattern.com/textpacks-download
2. Unzip the downloaded file.
3. Upload the files within to your server textpattern/lang directory.
4. Visit the Languages administration panel in your Textpattern admin area.
5. Click 'Update' alongside the language in the grid.
