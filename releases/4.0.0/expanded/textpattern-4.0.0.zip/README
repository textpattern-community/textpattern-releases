Installation

* Extract the files to your site (in the web root, or choose a 
  subdirectory). The top-level index.php should reside in this 
  directory, as should the /textpattern/ directory.
* Create, or establish the existence of, a working mysql database,
  load /textpattern/index.php in a browser, and follow the directions.

Upgrading

* Simply replace everything in your /textpattern/ directory (except 
  config.php) and the two files in your main installation directory 
  (index.php and .htaccess) with the corresponding files in this 
  distribution.
* When you login to the admin-side, the relevant upgrade script is 
  run automatically. Please take a look into diagnostics to find out 
  wether there are any errors and wether the correct version number 
  is displayed.
